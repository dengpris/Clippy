  <zone label="MET_ABSTRACT">Adventure and excitement have often been invoked to explain why people engage in political violence,
yet empirical evidence on the topic has thus far been anecdotal. The present research sought to fill this
gap in knowledge by examining the role of sensation seeking in political violence and integrating this
concept with Significance Quest Theory (Kruglanski, Chen, Dechesne, Fishman, &amp; Orehek, 2009;
Kruglanski et al., 2013). Extending prior research on violent extremism, Study 1 found that sensation
seeking mediated the relation between meaning in life and willingness to self-sacrifice and support for
political violence. Study 2 established temporal precedence of the variables in the mediation model, using
a longitudinal design. Studies 3 and 4 experimentally replicated findings of Studies 1 and 2. In Studies
5a and 5b, we found that sensation seeking predicts support for a real life violent activist group. In Studies
6a and 6b, the positive evaluation of a violent activist group by individuals high in sensation seeking was
explained by how exciting they perceived the group to be. Finally, Study 7 introduced an intervention
targeting the sensation seeking motive by presenting participants with a peaceful (less exciting vs.
exciting) activism group. As hypothesized, providing individuals high in sensation seeking with a
peaceful yet exciting group mitigated their support for extreme behavior.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Understanding what inspires humans to use violence and sacrifice
their lives for a cause is a pressing issue. In recent years, an unprecedented
number of politically and religiously motivated acts of violence
have taken place across the globe (Institute for Economics &amp;
Peace, 2017). In 2016, more than 13,400 terrorist attacks occurred
worldwide, resulting in more than 34,000 total deaths, including more
than 11,600 perpetrator deaths (Miller, 2017). In the same time period,
the United Nations Security Council (2015) estimated that more than
25,000 foreign fighters have traveled to join violent groups such as
Al-Qaeda and ISIS-a staggering exodus of young adults. Clearly,
there are strong psychological forces that compel individuals to join
violent groups. Unveiling the mechanisms behind these forces is
pivotal to reducing the capability of violent groups to recruit new
members.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Recently, scholars have discussed how youth might be lured to join
political or religious movements because of their yearning for adventure
and significance (Atran &amp; Sheikh, 2015; Kruglanski, Gelfand,
Bélanger, Sheveland, et al., 2014; Victoroff, 2005; Zimbardo, Ferreras,
&amp; Brunskill, 2015). We believe that the latter proposition can be
unpacked to provide a fuller and more precise account of why a
growing number of people are hearing and following the drum beat of
extremism. Although research has recently linked people's search for
meaning (or significance) with their willingness to self-sacrifice and use
violence for a cause (Bélanger, 2013; Bélanger, Caouette, Sharvit, &amp;
Dugas, 2014; Dugas et al., 2016; Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland,
et al., 2014), the role of sensation seeking in political extremism has
been suspected, but largely overlooked (Canadian Security Intelligence
Service, 2015; Kruglanski &amp; Fishman, 2006). In what follows, we postulate
that sensation seeking-the need for adventure and thrill-bridges
the gap between the search for meaning and extreme behavior. Furthermore,
we report converging evidence that the appeal of political violence
can be attenuated by providing a peaceful substitute that fulfills the need
for novel and intense sensations.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">The Significance Quest Theory</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The present work is grounded in Significance Quest Theory
(SQT; Kruglanski, Chen, Dechesne, Fishman, &amp; Orehek, 2009;</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">744

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland, et al., 2014; Kruglanski,
Gelfand, Bélanger, Gunaratna, et al., 2014; Kruglanski et al.,
2013; Kruglanski &amp; Orehek, 2011), which posits that the desire to
matter and to feel meaningful is a fundamental human need (see
also Frankl, 1959, 1966). Work guided by this theoretical framework
has shown that, when deprived of significance, people become
strongly motivated to initiate actions that allow them to
restore a sense of significance. In a series of cross-cultural studies,
Dugas et al. (2016) observed that significance can be restored
through self-sacrifice for a highly valued cause. For example, Iraqi
and Palestinian refugees living in Jordan reported greater willingness
to self-sacrifice when they felt insignificant. Experimentally
thwarting participants' need for competence and belongingness also
led to an increase in people's willingness to self-sacrifice. In their last
study, Dugas et al. (2016) found that making sacrifices at the behest
of an important cause increases feelings of significance. Specifically,
after recalling a time when they had made a sacrifice for a cause (vs.
recalling a pleasurable experience), participants reported greater pride,
personal worth, significance, and purpose in life.
Of particular relevance to the present research, previous studies
have also shown that the quest for significance predicts other extreme
forms of behavior such as support for political violence. In a sample
of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Bélanger (2013) showed that the
more extremists felt insignificant (i.e., small, worthless, and hopeless)
the more they supported armed struggle to obtain a separate country.
Notably, this relationship was mediated by terrorists' willingness to
self-sacrifice for their ideological convictions, which suggests that
loss of significance potentiates the readiness to endorse one's group's
ideology and risk life and limb for it.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Connecting the Search for Meaning to Extreme
Behaviors: The Role of Sensation Seeking</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">For decades, terrorism scholars and government agencies have
argued that one of the main appeals of terrorism is the possibility of
engaging in an exciting and thrilling social movement (Atran, 2014;
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2015; Hacker, 1983; Kellen,
1979; Levine, 1999; Nussio, 2017; Victoroff, 2005). This proposition
is consistent with several observations such as radicalized youth
traveling abroad to join the ranks of ISIS or al-Qaeda (United Nations
Security Council, 2015), retrospective accounts of individuals who
joined violent armed groups (Nussio, 2017), as well as a few accounts
of incarcerated violent extremists reporting excitement as a reason for
their involvement in ideologically driven movements (Juergensmeyer,
2000). Although the sensation-seeking-violent-extremism hypothesis
has been around for many years, support for it is merely anecdotal in
nature and needs to be subjected to empirical scrutiny.
There are in fact strong theoretical grounds to consider sensation
seeking in the radicalization process leading to violence. As stated
previously, the SQT postulates that individuals searching for meaning
are strongly motivated to restore significance (Kruglanski et al., 2013;
Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland, et al., 2014). To achieve
this goal, individuals need to find “the appropriate means to significance”
(Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland, et al., 2014, p. 74)
such as ideologies that “promise significance if only one followed its
dictates” (p. 81).
In the present research, we hypothesized that individuals who
search for meaning broaden their mind to novel, varied, and
exploratory thoughts and actions. Similar ideas have been discussed
by political scientist Quintan Wiktorowicz in his concept of
“cognitive opening” (2005)-the notion that individuals become
receptive to new ideas and worldviews in the aftermath of a
personal crisis (e.g., discrimination, socioeconomic disparities,
political repression, etc.)- or by Kurt Lewin (1947) in his seminal
work on force field theory. When individuals find important needs
thwarted, such as the need for meaning in life, they become
motivated to change (Lewin, 1947; Schein, 1996). Experiences
such as humiliation or discrimination demonstrate that previous
behavior is ineffective and hence, trigger “scanning,” that is,
individuals search for a solution by exposing themselves to a
variety of new information (Schein, 1996, see also Zand &amp; Sorensen,
1975). And indeed, there is evidence that openness and
curiosity can increase meaning in life (e.g., Kashdan &amp; Steger,
2007; Lavigne, Hofman, Ring, Ryder, &amp; Woodward, 2013).
In terms of our theory, the search for meaning in life (sparked by
a loss of significance, humiliation, or a personal crisis) motivates
people to look for novel and stimulating experiences in an attempt
to restore feelings of significance. This search is depicted in the
construct of sensation seeking, which has been defined as “the
seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and
experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and
financial risks for the sake of such experience” (Zuckerman, 1994,
p. 27). Such a relationship has been hypothesized earlier by existential
theorist Viktor Frankl (1959, 1966) and documented by
Melton and Schulenberg (2007) as well as Fahlman, Mercer,
Gaskovski, Eastwood, and Eastwood (2009), who found that lack
of meaning in life manifests itself in boredom proneness-a facet
of sensation seeking. Specifically, Fahlman et al. (2009) provided
causal evidence that meaning in life leads to boredom proneness,
which in turn, increases individuals' desire to engage in exciting
and stimulating activities (e.g., Berlyne, 1960; for a review see
Smith, 1981). Indeed, there is substantial evidence that boredom
leads to novelty seeking (Ha &amp; Jang, 2015) as well as to sensation
seeking behaviors such as impulsive, risky, violent, and dangerous
behaviors (Baumeister &amp; Campbell, 1999; for an overview see
Boden, 2009). Overall, it follows that sensation seeking induced
through the search for meaning could facilitate people's adherence
to new exciting beliefs including (but not limited to) fighting for a
political cause and risking life and limbs for it.
The idea that engaging in risky or aggressive problem behaviors
as the result of a lack of meaning in life is well documented (e.g.,
Brassai, Piko, &amp; Steger, 2011; Frankl, 1966; Shek, Ma, &amp; Cheung,
1994). For instance, our theorizing is in line with Orit TaubmanBen-Ari
(2004), who argues that young people are prone to finding
a “sense of aliveness” in risky behaviors ('walking on the edge,' p.
106). The excitement and thrill of extreme and dangerous behaviors
can intensify one's sense of living a meaningful existence
(Taubman-Ben-Ari, 2011) or provide an opportunity to escape
negative self-awareness (Baumeister, 1991; Taylor &amp; Hamilton,
1997). Moreover, exciting and sensation-affording activities can
be significance-lending because they often demand courage and
hence can lead to admiration and confirm important attributes of
personal identity (Jessor, 1982, 1991). In that sense, sensation
seeking behavior can be understood as means to the goal of feeling
significant (e.g., Kruglanski, Chernikova, Babush, Dugas, &amp;
Schumpe, 2015; Kruglanski et al., 2002). This is in line with Jessor
(1982, p. 196), who argues that engaging in problem behaviors can
be seen as “purposeful, meaningful, goal-oriented and functional</zone>
  <zone label="MET_BIB_INFO">SENSATION SEEKING IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">745</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">rather than arbitrary or perverse” (see also Köpetz, 2017). This is
so because the immediate gain is deemed more important than
potential long term costs (Jessor, 1991). Although meaning can
also be achieved by other significance-lending means such as
notable and admired achievements, the thrill of excitement and
adventure offers a more immediate solution (cf. Martin, 1999;
Zimbardo &amp; Coulombe, 2016). Taken together, we hypothesize
that the search for meaning can trigger the opening to novel,
varied, and intense stimulation, meaning that it can lead to sensation
seeking.
Although its relation to politically or religiously motivated
violence has never been empirically tested, a rich literature on
sensation seeking (e.g., Zuckerman, 1969, 1979, 2007) has discussed
people's need to seek out novel and intense stimulation. For
example, sensation seeking has been positively related to a variety
of high-risk activities such as criminal behavior (Horvath &amp; Zuckerman,
1993), delinquency in youth (Pérez &amp; Torrubia, 1985),
reckless driving, speeding, smoking marijuana or using other illegal
drugs, as well as risky sexual behaviors (Arnett, 1998; Bradley
&amp; Wildman, 2002; Charnigo et al., 2013; Jonah, 1997; TaubmanBen-Ari,
Eherenfreund-Hager, &amp; Prato, 2016; Zuckerman, Eysenck,
&amp; Eysenck, 1978). Sensation seeking has also been associated
with a preference for high-risk sports (e.g., skydiving or
rock climbing, Jack &amp; Ronan, 1998; Zuckerman, 1983), watching
fights, or actively engaging in them (Russell, 2004; Russell &amp;
Arms, 1998).
Overall, sensation seeking predicts negative risks such as drug
use and criminal activities, but it also predicts positive risks such
as sports, riding roller coasters, and going on blind dates (Fischer
&amp; Smith, 2004). Moreover, there is also evidence that individuals
high in sensation seeking look for riskier jobs such as police
officers, fire-fighters, and rescue units (Goma`-i-Freixanet, Pérez,
&amp; Torrubia, 1988; Montag &amp; Birenbaum, 1986), showing that
sensation seeking is not uniquely associated with violence. Thus,
understanding how the need for novel and exciting experiences can
be redirected toward prosocial endeavors appears vital to help
people reach their goals without resorting to violence.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Interventions Targeting the Sensation Seeking Motive</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Historically, the study of sensation seeking (Zuckerman, 1969)
began with the finding that individuals react differently to sensory
deprivation: some individuals need more stimulation than others to
feel comfortable. Berlyne (1960, 1971) suggested a curvilinear
relationship between the arousal potential of stimuli and their
hedonic value: Low-arousing stimuli elicited little or no pleasurable
affect; moderately arousing stimuli produced a pleasurable
affective response, but beyond a maximal level of arousal, pleasantness
decreases. Because optimal levels of stimulation and
arousal vary among individuals (Eysenck, 1963, 1967; Gray, 1964;
Zuckerman, 1969; Zuckerman, Kolin, Price, &amp; Zoob, 1964), people
differ in how much they need novel and intense stimulation to
feel and function well (Zuckerman et al., 1964).
Given that sensation seeking is related to numerous unhealthy and
illegal behaviors (e.g., Newcomb &amp; McGee, 1991), prevention and
intervention messages have been tailored to the needs of high sensation
seekers. To this end, Palmgreen and colleagues (Palmgreen &amp;
Donohew, 2010; Palmgreen, Donohew, Lorch, Hoyle, &amp; Stephenson,
2001) developed the SENTAR (SENsation seeking TARgeting)
model that posits that individuals high in sensation seeking prefer
stimulating messages with high sensation value (Donohew, Lorch, &amp;
Palmgreen, 1991). For instance, high sensation value can involve
messages that are novel, complex, intense, and involve sudden
changes (Berlyne, 1960, 1971). Thus, to reach at-risk populations, that
is, individuals high in sensation seeking, the content as well as the
context of the messages needs to be considered. Accordingly,
Palmgreen and Donohew (2010) tested high sensation value messages
for health campaigns (e.g., TV public service announcements) placed
in high sensation value context (dramatic, fast-paced TV content).
The effectiveness of the SENTAR approach was demonstrated
for reducing behaviors such as drug use and risky sex (e.g.,
Palmgreen et al., 2001; Zimmerman et al., 2007). Since then, the
SENTAR approach has guided several large-scale prevention and
intervention programs (Palmgreen, Lorch, Stephenson, Hoyle, &amp;
Donohew, 2007). Attesting to its effectiveness, individuals high
(versus low) in sensation seeking paid more attention to public
service announcements in drug use prevention programs that were
high (versus low) in stimulation and embedded in TV programs
that were high (versus low) in sensation value (Lorch et al., 1994).
Furthermore, individuals high in sensation seeking were more
likely to call a helpline when presented with a stimulating (versus
nonstimulating) public service announcement (Palmgreen et al.,
1995). Overall, SENTAR uses communication strategies tailored
to the needs of individuals inclined to engage in various risky and
unhealthy behaviors.
The literature on sensation seeking also points to the importance
of providing alternative means to satisfy sensation-related needs
(Arnett, 1995; Roberti, 2004). One example can be found in the
realm of risky sex in homosexual men whereby sensation seeking
strongly correlates with the frequency of unprotected anal intercourse,
which poses a great risk for HIV infection (Dudley, Rostosky,
Korfhage, &amp; Zimmerman, 2004; Kalichman, Heckman, &amp;
Kelly, 1996). Zuckerman (2007) suggested intervention programs
proposing alternative forms of sexual gratification that are less
risky than coital sex, such as mutual masturbation and oral sex.
With regard to drug abuse treatment programs, Zuckerman
(2007) observed that the question of how life would look after drug
cessation comes up regularly. Working a monotonous 9-to-5 job or
settling down in a monogamous relationship is not in line with the
motives of most sensation seekers. Therefore, it has been suggested
that programs should offer more healthy alternatives for the
expression of the sensation seeking motive that are also able to
satisfy arousal related needs (Arnett, 1995; Roberti, 2004; Zuckerman,
2007).</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Counteracting Political Violence by Addressing
Psychological Needs</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The foregoing analysis indicates that prevention and intervention
messages should be tailored to address recipients' psychological
needs and provide healthier alternatives to satisfy them. Thus,
if wanting to engage in political violence is indeed fueled by the
desire for novel and stimulating experiences, it follows that antiviolence
campaigns are more likely to be effective if they address
these psychological motives. However, one observation concerning
current campaigns against political violence is that they generally
advocate for moderation when trying to persuade young
adults not to join violent groups. As Upal (2015) observes, “most</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">746
SCHUMPE, BÉLANGER, MOYANO, AND NISA</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">of our ad-hoc counter narrative efforts on both social and traditional
mass media focus on pointing out logical absurdities of
Jihadist worldview (e.g., 'so DAESH wants to build a future, well
is beheading a future you want, or someone controlling details of
your diet and dress'), but do not offer a well thought out comprehensive
alternative narrative” (p. 65). This discrepancy led us to
believe that current antiviolence campaigns would be more effective
when tapping into the psychological needs of at-risk populations.
Specifically, providing exciting, yet peaceful, alternatives,
such as nonviolent groups, could potentially channel the sensation
seeking motive in a prosocial direction. This echoes anthropologist
and terrorism expert, Scott Atran, who observed that in the context
of preventing Islamist extremism, appeals to “moderate Islam” are
likely to fail because these messages are not tailored to the youth's
psychological needs. He notes: “When I hear another tired appeal
to 'moderate Islam,' usually from much older folk, I ask: Are you
kidding? Do not any of you have teenage children? When did
'moderate' anything have wide appeal for youth yearning for
adventure, glory, and significance?” (Atran, 2015, p. 3). Accordingly,
Atran (2015) emphasized the necessity of providing the
youth with exciting life projects that enable them to find a meaningful
existence within society. The quest for personal significance
also makes a similar prediction: “Whether a prosocial or antisocial
behavior is enacted should depend on the ideology that identifies
the means to significance. Producing a shift from a terrorismwarranting
ideology to one that identifies alternative routes to
significance thus seems essential to eliminating violence” (Kruglanski,
Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland, et al., 2014, p. 79). In line
with this proposition, our objective is to test whether providing an
exciting, yet peaceful, alternative to political violence would steer
sensation seekers away from violent groups.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Overview of Studies</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The present research examined the role of sensation seeking in
political violence by integrating this concept to SQT. Extending prior
work on extremism (Bélanger, 2013; Dugas et al., 2016), Study 1
examined whether sensation seeking would mediate the relationship
between search for meaning in life and extreme behavior (i.e., selfsacrifice
and support for political violence). Study 2 replicated Study
1 using a longitudinal design to demonstrate that the search for
meaning is associated with sensation seeking, which, in turn, prospectively
predicts support for political violence three months later. Studies
3 and 4 conceptually replicated Studies 1 and 2 using experimental
manipulations of meaning in life. In Studies 5a and 5b, we tested the
hypothesis that activists' sensation seeking would be positively associated
with supporting a violent political group. Studies 6a and 6b
sought to explore the underlying psychological mechanism related to
Study 5's findings by examining activists' excitement toward the
violent group. After identifying sensation seeking as a predictor of
extreme behavior and understanding that perceiving violence as exciting
is what attracts sensation seekers to these groups, we tested an
intervention to mitigate support for political violence. Specifically, in
Study 7, we presented activists with an exciting -yet peaceful- alternative
group to reduce support for political violence among high
sensation seekers.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Study 1</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The purpose of Study 1 was to provide initial evidence that
sensation seeking plays a role in political violence. Whereas previous
research has established that search for meaning increases
support for extreme behaviors (i.e., self-sacrifice and support for
political violence, Bélanger, 2013; Dugas et al., 2016), this study
aims to demonstrate that this relationship is mediated by the desire
for novel and stimulating experiences. Thus overall, we predicted
that search for meaning would be positively associated with sensation
seeking, which in turn would be positively related with the
willingness to self-sacrifice for a cause and, consequently, lead to
support for political violence.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Method</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Participants and design. To estimate the sample size needed
to test our mediation model, we used the tool developed by
Schoemann, Boulton, and Short (2017). Assuming small to moderate
effect sizes and setting power at .80, a sample size of 445
people was suggested. In this study, 460 participants (293 women,
Mage 31.45, SDage 13.90) from Andalusia, Spain participated
in this research on a voluntary basis. Data were collected through
face-to-face interviews.
Procedure and materials. Participants responded to a questionnaire
intended to measure search for meaning, sensation seeking,
willingness to self-sacrifice, support for violence, as well as
demographics. Studies 1 and 2 were conducted at a University in
Spain, where no Research Ethics Committee or Institutional Review
Board is implemented or required.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Measures.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Search for meaning. We used the five-item scale by Steger,
Frazier, Oishi, and Kaler (2006) to assess the extent to which
participants search for meaning in their lives ( .90; e.g., “I am
always searching for something that makes my life feel significant”;
1 Absolutely untrue; 7 Absolutely true).
Sensation seeking. Sensation seeking was measured using
Hoyle, Stephenson, Palmgreen, Lorch, and Donohew's (2002)
eight-item scale ( .82; e.g., “I would love to have new and
exciting experiences, even if they are illegal”; 1 Strongly disagree;
5 Strongly agree).
Willingness to self-sacrifice. Participants' willingness to selfsacrifice
for a cause was assessed using the 10-item ( .87) scale
developed by Bélanger et al. (2014). Example items include “I
would be ready to give my life for a cause that is extremely dear
to me” (1 Not agree at all; 7 Very strongly agree).
Support for political violence. We used the 21-item ( .81)
belief toward violence scale developed by Bélanger, Richardson,
Lafrenière, McCaffery, and Framand (2017) to measure participants'
support for violence (e.g., “Violence is permissible when
conducted by a group fighting for a just cause” and “No cause is
important enough to justify the killing of civilians (reversescored)”;
1 Strongly disagree; 6 Strongly agree).</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Results and Discussion</zone>

gender differences in the sensation seeking motive have been
frequently reported (Zuckerman, 1979, 2007). In total, seven paths
were specified: One path from search for meaning to sensation
seeking, one path from sensation seeking to self-sacrifice, one path
from sensation seeking to support for political violence, one path
from self-sacrifice to support for political violence, as well as three
paths from gender to the predicted variables (see Figure 1). We
display means, standard deviations, and correlations for all measures
in Table 1.1 Results revealed that the hypothesized model fits
the data well, 2(df 2, N 460) 1.16, p .561, GFI .99,
CFI 1.00, IFI 1.00, RMSEA .00, AIC 27.16.
Search for meaning predicted sensation seeking ( .24, p
.001), which predicted willingness to self-sacrifice ( .15, p
.001), which in turn predicted support for political violence (
.16, p .001). Bootstrapped confidence interval estimates of the
indirect effect (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008) were calculated to test the
significance of mediation. Results showed an indirect effect of
search for meaning on support for political violence via sensation
seeking and willingness to self-sacrifice ( .04; 95% CI [.01,
.06]). Sensation seeking was also predictive of support for political
violence ( .12, p .007). Gender was significantly related to
sensation seeking ( .11, p .019) and support for political
violence ( .18, p .001), but not to self-sacrifice ( .04,
p .43).
Findings of Study 1 provide initial evidence for the role of
sensation seeking in explaining people's willingness to engage in
violence. Specifically, our model hypothesized a mediating effect
of sensation seeking between search for meaning and willingness
to self-sacrifice and support for political violence. Therefore, results
of Study 1 extend prior work that found a connection between
search for meaning in life and extreme behaviors (i.e., selfTable

mechanism that links the search for meaning to greater willingness
to self-sacrifice and to engage in violent behaviors. Moreover,
these findings are consistent with the concepts of cognitive opening
(Wiktorowicz, 2005) and scanning (Lewin, 1947; Schein,
1996) that were hypothesized to occur when the fundamental need
to feel meaningful is not fulfilled. One limitation of Study 1 is that
it remains of correlational nature. To further corroborate the direction
of the effect, Study 2 implemented a longitudinal design.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Study 2</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Radicalization leading to violence is a process that takes time.
However, research to date has not shown how this process exactly
unfolds. We believe the process starts with the search for meaning,
which increases the desire for novel experiences. This makes
people more susceptible to adhere to extreme ideological beliefs
supporting political violence. In Study 2, we employed a longitudinal
design to test for the effect of search for meaning on support
for political violence via increased sensation seeking over the
course of several months. The implemented design allowed us to
measure the hypothesized cause (search for meaning at time point
1) as well as the hypothesized mechanism (sensation seeking at
time point 1) before the hypothesized consequence (change in
support for political violence at time point 2). Moreover, we
controlled for support for political violence at time point 1, thereby
ruling out potential confounds (Gollob &amp; Reichardt, 1991; Heaven
&amp; Ciarrochi, 2008; Soenens et al., 2008).</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Method</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Participants and design. We used the same tool as in Study
1 to estimate the required sample size. Setting power at .80 and
assuming small to moderate effect sizes, the suggested sample size
was 325 respondents (320 if we based estimations on the correlation
matrix obtained in Study 1). We aimed for 370 participants
because of an anticipated dropout of about 10%, which seems
typical for longitudinal studies (e.g., Weiss, 2005). Three hundred
seventy-one participants from Spain (269 women; Mage 27.89,

later, 269 participants (197 women, Mage 27.70, SDage 11.74)
completed the survey again.
Procedure and materials. Participants responded to an online
questionnaire measuring their search for meaning in life,
sensation seeking, support for political violence, and demographics
at two time points (November 2016 and February 2017). Short
versions of the scales were utilized to keep the time it took to
complete the questionnaire as well as participant attrition to a
minimum.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Measures.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Search for meaning. We used three items of the scale used in
Study 1 (Time 1: .80; Time 2: .85).
Sensation seeking. We used four items of the scale used in
Study 1 (Time 1: .69; Time 2: .76).
Support for political violence. We used seven items of the
scale used in Study 1 (Time 1: .62; Time 2: .70).</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Results and Discussion</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Between time points 1 and 2, there was an attrition rate of about
27%. First, we tested for a possible attrition bias (Goodman &amp;
Blum, 1996; Miller &amp; Hollist, 2007). We used logistic regression
to test whether age, gender, search for meaning, sensation seeking,
or support for political violence at time point 1 was predictive of
participants either finishing at time point 2 or dropping out of the
survey (all ps .12). Therefore, we can conclude that participants
who dropped out after time point 1 were not systematically different
from those who completed the study at time point 2.
Second, we tested the mediating role of sensation seeking in the
relationship between search for meaning and support for political
violence. Analyses were conducted with AMOS (Arbuckle, 2007)
and maximum likelihood estimation procedure. Akin to Study 1,
we included gender (coded 0 male; 1 female) as a control
variable. More importantly, the longitudinal design of Study 2
controlled for support for political violence at time point 1 to rule
out a possible confound. In total, six paths were specified: One
path from search for meaning to sensation seeking, one path from
sensation seeking to support for political violence, as well as four
paths from the control variables to the predicted variables (see
Figure 2). We display means, standard deviations, and correlations
for all measures in Table 2. Results revealed that the hypothesized

Search for meaning at time point 1 predicted sensation seeking
at time point 1 ( .32, p .001), which predicted support for
political violence at time point 2 ( .12, p .02). Bootstrapped
confidence interval estimates (Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008) showed an
indirect effect of search for meaning on support for political
violence via sensation seeking ( .03; 95% CI [.006, .069]).
Support for political violence at time point 1 was related to
sensation seeking at time point 1 ( .25, p .001) and to
support for political violence at time point 2 ( .65, p .001).
Gender was related to sensation seeking at time point 1 ( .11,
p .04), but not to support for political violence at time point 2
( .04, p .35).
Replicating Study 1, results supported the hypothesized mediating
effect of sensation seeking between search for meaning and
support for political violence. Moreover, Study 2 demonstrated
that radicalization is a process that unfolds over time: Sensation
seeking increased as a result of heightened search for meaning
in life, which then led to greater support for political violence
later on.
Study 2 overcomes limitation of Study 1 by providing evidence
for the causal relationship between the variables in our modelbecause
a fundamental requirement for causality is that one variable
precedes the other in time (Holland, 1986; Sobel, 1990).
However, only an experiment in which search for meaning is
manipulated allows to test the hypothesized causal relationship
between variables in our model.

Study 3
Study 3 tested the causal relationship of our model. We expected
that experimentally increasing people's meaning in life would
decrease their need for sensation seeking and thus, reduce their
support for political violence. Specifically, we hypothesized that
individuals who reflect on their current legacy (i.e., something to
pass on to make a meaningful, lasting and energizing contribution
to humanity; Cave, 2012; Kotre, 1999), would perceive more
meaning in their lives and thus report lower sensation seeking and
support for political violence.
Method
Participants and design. Expecting a strong effect of the
experimental manipulation, we estimated the sample size to be 112
participants with power set at .80. The final sample comprised 121
participants (64 women, Mage 31.73 SDage 6.91) on MTurk
for an experimental design with two conditions.
Procedure and materials. Participants read a short text defining
what a legacy is (i.e., something to pass on; a meaningful
contribution to humanity). Then, they were randomly assigned to
one of two experimental conditions. In the legacy condition, participants
were asked to write down their current legacy. In the
control condition, participants were asked to write about their
favorite style of sports shoes. Next, we measured search for
meaning, sensation seeking, support for political violence, as well
as demographic variables. This study as well as all following
studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (“Sensation

in turn predicted sensation seeking ( .18, p .045), which was
positively associated with support for political violence ( .37,
p .001). We calculated bootstrapped confidence interval estimates
(Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008) and confirmed the indirect effect
( .01; 95% CI [ .044, .001]).
In support of our theorizing, experimentally increasing meaning
in people's lives lowered sensation seeking and consequently, their
support for political violence. This suggests that giving meaning,
and thus, fulfilling the quest for personal significance, has a
trickle-down effect on other motives such as the desire to engage
in novel and exciting experiences and thus, help people steer clear
from political violence. Accordingly, we demonstrated the causal
relationship between the variables of our postulated model. However,
Study 3 had a small sample size and the manipulation was
only geared toward decreasing (vs. increasing) the search for
meaning. Study 4 was conducted to overcome these limitations.</zone>

Activists who searched for meaning in their lives reported greater

mediated by sensation seeking. This begs the question of why
political violence is so alluring to individuals high in sensation
seeking. In line with previous research that linked sensation seeking
to a preference for a variety of exciting activities (e.g., Zuckerman,

attracted by violent groups because they perceive them as exciting.</zone>

excitement between sensation seeking and the evaluation of the

Results of Study 6a support the notion that violent groups are
liked by individuals high in sensation seeking because they perceive
those groups as exciting. Therefore, individuals high in
sensation seeking can be considered more at risk of joining political
violent groups. In the next study, we aimed at replicating this
relationship in another sample of animal rights activists.</zone>

Sensation seeking predicted how exciting participants perceived
the activist group to be ( .33, p .001), which, in turn, was
positively associated with the evaluation of the group ( .88,

Again, results of Study 6b support the notion that violent activists
groups are liked by activists high in sensation seeking because
they perceive those groups to be exciting. This is of high relevance
to the present research, because it adds to the body of knowledge
crucial for the creation of effective antiviolence campaigns. In
the next study, we tested an intervention that applied this new

participants with an exciting, yet peaceful, activist group (vs. an
unexciting one) would lower their support for political violence,
which in turn would reduce support for a violent activists group.</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Participants and design. Based on pilot testing, we estimated
the required sample size to be 392 participants with power set to
.80. We recruited 392 participants (95 women; Mage 36.24,
SDage 11.27) via MTurk. The study explicitly asked for animal
right activists.
Procedure and materials. Participants were randomly assigned
to one of two experimental conditions. They were either
presented with an unexciting or exciting peaceful animal rights
activist group to further their cause. The unexciting group was
described as using formal statements, such as signed public statements,
letters of opposition, or pamphlets. Furthermore, they engaged
in nonconsumption of boycotted goods, withdrawal from
government educational institutions, sit-downs, or pray-ins. The
exciting activist group was described as using the methods of public
assemblies, such as performances of plays and music. They also
engaged in marches, parades, humorous skits and pranks, speeches
advocating resistance, and refused to disperse assemblages.2
2 The methods that were used to describe the group as exciting (versus
unexciting) were pretested. We asked 50 participants on MTurk to rate the
extent to which they perceived the methods of nonviolent political action
(taken from Sharp, 1973) as exciting. As a result, characteristics in the
unexciting activist group (M 2.77, SD 1.17) were perceived as less
exciting than characteristics in the exciting group (M 4.02, SD 1.29;

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Results and Discussion</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">First, we conducted a manipulation check on how exciting the
activist groups were perceived. As expected, the exciting group
(M 5.17, SD 1.27) was perceived as more exciting than the
unexciting group (M 4.41, SD 1.71; F(1, 390) 25.05, p
.001, 2 .06). Next, we tested the interactive effect of sensation
seeking and the experimental condition on support for political
violence via willingness to self-sacrifice. Five paths were specified:
one from sensation seeking to support for political violence,
one from sensation seeking to evaluation of the violent activist
group, one from experimental condition (coded 0 unexciting
activist group, 1 exciting activist group) to support for political
violence, one path from the interaction term to support for violence,
and one path from support for violence to the evaluation of
the violent activist group (see Figure 7). We display means,
standard deviations, and correlations for all measures in Table 7.
In line with Aiken and West's (1991) procedures, independent
variables were standardized before calculating the interaction
products. We tested the interaction (Sensation seeking Experimental
condition) on support for political violence using hierarchical
multiple regression analyses to test the a-path of this model.

significant amount of variance, F(2, 389) 91.00, p .001,
R2 .32. Experimental condition ( .03, p .44) was
unrelated to support for political violence but sensation seeking
was ( .56, p .001). The addition of the interaction term in
Step 2 further increased explained variance significantly, F(1,
388) 5.91, p .02, R2 .01. Experimental condition
( .03, p .44) was unrelated to support for political violence
but sensation seeking was ( .56, p .001). The interactive
effect of sensation seeking and experimental condition was predictive
of support for political violence ( .10, p .02; see
Table 8).
To probe the nature of the interaction, we computed the conditional
effects of experimental condition on support for political
violence for low (1 SD below the mean) versus high (1 SD above
the mean) levels of sensation seeking. Results showed that the
effect was significant for high levels of sensation seeking
( .03, 95% CI [ .05, .01], t(388) 2.27, p .02), but
not for low levels of sensation seeking ( .01, 95% CI [ .01,

b-path in the model. Results indicated that the association between
support for political violence and the evaluation of the violent
activist group was significant ( .57, p .001).

  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">General Discussion</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The needs for adventure and significance have often been invoked
to explain people's adherence to politically violent groups
(Atran, 2014; Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland, et al.,
2014; Nussio, 2017). Whereas substantial evidence has been accumulated
to demonstrate the role of significance in political
violence (e.g., Bélanger, 2013; Dugas et al., 2016; Webber, Klein,
Kruglanski, Brizi, &amp; Merari, 2017), empirical research has thus far
been silent regarding the notion of excitement and adventure-a
peculiar observation given that sensation seeking has been a primary
suspect for many years (e.g., Kruglanski &amp; Fishman, 2006).
Dissatisfied with the current state of affairs, the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service (2015) even published a report urging scholars
to clarify the role of sensation seeking in political violence. In
response to this call for research and the pressing need to prevent
political violence, we conducted seven studies integrating sensation
seeking to SQT.
In Study 1, we demonstrated that the effect of search for
meaning on willingness to self-sacrifice and support for political
violence was mediated by sensation seeking. In Study 2, we tested
our model using a longitudinal design: search for meaning positively
predicted sensation seeking, which, in turn, prospectively
predicted support for political violence three months later. In
Studies 3 and 4, experimentally manipulating search for meaning
in life altered participants' sensation seeking, which then impacted
their support for political violence. Demonstrating the real-world
relevance of our theorizing, Studies 5a and 5b found that sensation
seeking was positively related to supporting a violent activist
group. In Studies 6a and 6b, we found that this relationship was
explained by how exciting the group was perceived. Building on
this evidence, we posited that rechanneling this desire for exciting
experiences toward a peaceful objective would be possible. Accordingly,
in Study 7 we presented activists with an exciting (vs.
unexciting), yet peaceful, alternative group, and successfully lowered
support for political violence among high (vs. low) sensation
seekers. Taken together, our findings indicate that the need for
novel and exciting experiences fuels people's interest in political
violence, but it can also be rechanneled toward peaceful political
movements that are engaging and exciting.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Theoretical Implications
The significance quest theory. The SQT posits that the loss</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">of significance prompts individuals to search and find “the appropriate
means to significance” (Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger,
Sheveland, et al., 2014, p. 74). The main contribution of this work
consists of providing a fuller account of how this search unfolds by
(a) examining a psychological mechanism involved in the search
for meaning and (b) identifying the types of means that are
preferred to fulfill that quest. Specifically, our results indicate that
to restore their significance, people pay increased attention to
novel and exciting experiences-they become sensation seekers
and thus, increasingly allured to extreme behaviors (self-sacrifice
and violence) and to groups that carry out such activities. These
results empirically substantiate Wiktorowicz's (2005) concept of
cognitive opening, whereby people seek novel and stimulating
experiences in times of personal crisis and thus, become more
receptive to alternative worldviews and extreme ideologies. Moreover,
our theorizing and findings are in line with Lewin's force
field theory (1947), in which he describes that individuals unfreeze
when important needs, such as the need for a meaningful existence,
are thwarted. They start to “scan,” that is, they search for
novel ideas and experiences to find a solution (Schein, 1996).
When they find an answer, people refreeze, which can be reflected
in attitude change (Lewin, 1947; Zand &amp; Sorensen, 1975). In the
context of violent extremism, this seizing and freezing can come in
the form of accepting extremist ideologies or joining extremist
groups that provide the certainty or opportunity for significance
restoration that individuals were looking for (Webber et al., 2018).
The process of radicalization triggered by significance loss can be
understood as the opening to new and extreme ideas and ideologies,
which is then followed by a closing of the mind and freezing
on the extremist beliefs.
Contrary to what is generally understood from the relationship
between sensation seeking and aggression, the need for excitement
and thrill does not necessarily “doom” one to adhere to hostile
belief systems. Indeed, as shown in Study 7, the relationship
between sensation seeking and support for political violence can
be reversed when a peaceful and exciting alternative is made
Figure 8. Interaction between sensation seeking and experimental condition
(unexciting vs. exciting activist group) on support for political
violence (Study 7).</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">756
SCHUMPE, BÉLANGER, MOYANO, AND NISA</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">accessible. Under such circumstances, violence is no longer the
only means available to experience stimulating sensations and thus
loses its appeal among high sensation seekers. Therefore, contrary
to generally held beliefs, our research demonstrates that sensation
seeking is not inevitably associated with support for political
violence, it can be redirected toward prosocial and constructive
activities. These findings substantiate the SQT's proposition that
when the significance quest is activated “whether a prosocial or
antisocial behavior is enacted should depend on the ideology that
identifies the means to significance” (Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger,
Sheveland, et al., 2014, p. 79). This idea connects well with
Katz's (1960) notion that attitudes have a function-they are
means to psychological goals. In the present case, supporting
extreme forms of activism (i.e., self-sacrifice and support for
political violence) provides the stimulation and excitement that
appear relevant to living a meaningful existence. However, as our
research shows, extreme behaviors can be substituted with means
that are functionally equivalent such as other exciting peaceful
activities or groups.
Taken together, although scholars have mentioned the “need for
adventure and significance” in the same breath (as if they were
additive factors) to describe the motivational determinants of political
extremism, in the present research, we articulated and adduced
empirical evidence for a model that unpacks this proposition
and demonstrate how these components are interrelated and part of
a motivational process. Consequently, the present research builds
on the SQT (e.g., Dugas et al., 2016; Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger,
Sheveland, et al., 2014) by (a) shedding light on a psychological
mechanism that connects the search for meaning to extremism
(i.e., self-sacrifice and support for political violence) and (b)
underscoring how to redirect the quest for significance to reduce
support for political violence. Of note, the current findings demonstrate
only one out of several possible mechanisms that link the
quest for significance to extreme outcomes (see Webber &amp; Kruglanski,
2016). For instance, some individuals rather choose to
restore their feelings of significance through personal and professional
achievements.
Sensation seeking theory. The present research also contributes
to the literature on sensation seeking in many ways. Indeed,
although sensation seeking has been linked to aggressive behavior
(Wilson &amp; Scarpa, 2011), this is, to our knowledge, the first
research demonstrating empirically the link between sensation
seeking and political violence. This is noteworthy, as the scientific
literature has put much emphasis on the relationship between
sensation seeking and reactive, that is, more impulsive forms of
violent behavior (e.g., criminal behavior or reckless driving; Bradley
&amp; Wildman, 2002; Horvath &amp; Zuckerman, 1993; Jonah, 1997).
However, the present research demonstrates that it also relates to
violent behaviors connected to a greater ideological purpose.
Therefore, our research corroborates recent findings that sensation
seeking is not only related to reactive, but also proactive (i.e.,
planned) forms of aggressive behaviors (Cui, Colasante, Malti,
Ribeaud, &amp; Eisner, 2016; Pérez Fuentes, Molero Jurado, Carrión
Martínez, Mercader Rubio, &amp; Gázquez, 2016). Reactive and proactive
forms of aggression (e.g., Dodge &amp; Coie, 1987) operate
differently: whereas reactive aggression is often an impulsive and
emotional reaction to provocation, proactive aggression is deliberate
and goal-directed. Hence, as shown in Study 7, interventions
that provide substitute means (i.e., exciting and peaceful groups) to
reorient behavior toward a similar goal can be effective and, in this
case, mitigate support for violence.
Another contribution of this work is that, although sensation
seeking gradually changes over the life span, it is usually understood
as a fairly stable biologically based personality trait (Zuckerman,
1974, 2007). The present research does not contend against
the latter proposition but enriches it by providing additional evidence
that there is room for momentary fluctuations in sensation
seeking following short-lived experimental inductions (see also
Fischer, Kastenmüller, &amp; Asal, 2012; Gamble &amp; Walker, 2016;
Petrocelli, Martin, &amp; Li, 2010), as adaptation to situational demands
(Lynne-Landsman, Graber, Nichols, &amp; Botvin, 2011; Parmak,
Euwema, &amp; Mylle, 2012), or as a result of intervention
programs (e.g., Burnette et al., 2004). This was especially apparent
in Studies 3 and 4 when after recalling events that either increased
or decreased individuals' search for meaning, their desire for novel
and stimulating experiences changed respectively. This evidence is
consistent with Higgins' (2008) theoretical and empirically validated
proposition that the concept of personality is simply “one
source of variability in the functioning of psychological principles
that also varies across momentary situations” (p. 612), which
suggests that psychological constructs can be alternatively operationalized
either as individual differences or as expressions of
situational forces (e.g., Duggan, 2004; Kruglanski &amp; Sheveland,
2012; Sturaro, Denissen, van Aken, &amp; Asendorpf, 2008). It follows
that our research demonstrates that sensation seeking is not simply
a drive dictated by biological imperatives-it is also goal-driven as
it steers individuals to explore and engage in novel activities in the
pursuit of feeling significant. In this light, sensation seeking goes
beyond wanting to experience a tingle to the spine; it can be
understood as a self-regulatory mechanism triggered by the loss of
significance. Therefore, the present research suggests that sensation
seeking behaviors are not always the result of poor selfregulation
(see also Taylor &amp; Hamilton, 1997); quite the contrary,
they can reflect people's ability to respond to the ongoing demands
of experience in search of a meaningful existence.</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">Practical Implications</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Our findings also bear important practical implications for
community-based organizations (e.g., Germany's Hayat program,
Montreal's Center for the Prevention of Radicalization leading to
Violence, Denmark's Aarhus program) whose purpose is to prevent
and counter violent extremism by engaging individuals with
strong political convictions spanning the full ideological spectrum
(e.g., left- and right-wing extremism, eco-extremism, radical Islam,
etc.).
Detecting extremism. Chief among the challenges that practitioners
(e.g., social workers, psychologists) working for these
organizations face, is identifying individuals that might be at risk
of adhering to political violence so that preemptive efforts can be
conducted to prevent their radicalization. The present research
suggests being especially attentive to individuals that might be (a)
in search for meaning and (b) display a proclivity for novel and
intense experiences. Concretely, this means recognizing (a) personal
situations that may increase one's likelihood of experiencing
significance loss such as humiliation, disempowerment, and social
stigmatization (Bélanger, 2013; Dugas et al., 2016; Webber, Klein,
Kruglanski, Brizi, &amp; Merari, 2017) and (b) individuals who tend to</zone>
  <zone label="MET_BIB_INFO">SENSATION SEEKING IN POLITICAL VIOLENCE</zone>
  <zone label="GEN_OTHER">757</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">be nonconformists and engage in behavior involving risk-two
common indicators associated with high sensation seeking (Ang &amp;
Woo, 2003; Arnaut, 2006; Zuckerman, Bone, Neary, Mangelsdorff,
&amp; Brustman, 1972). Noting these telltale signs early on
might be necessary for effective and timely prevention initiatives
to steer people away from politically violent groups.
Countermessaging strategies. This raises the question of
what these initiatives should be to prevent individuals' adherence
to political violence. In recent years, one burgeoning field of
initiatives has been countermessaging initiatives (also known as
counternarratives) to fight for the “hearts and minds” of potential
recruits for extremism. These initiatives typically consist of media
campaigns on social media platforms aimed at tarnishing the brand
of politically violent groups and their militant ideology to dissuade
those that might be interested in joining their ranks.
Despite the widespread use of countermessaging by governments,
NGOs, and grass-root movements (e.g., student-groups),
one of the main issues concerning this approach is the absence of
evidence supporting its effectiveness (see Davies, Neudecker,
Ouellet, Bouchard, &amp; Ducol, 2016; Ferguson, 2016; Hemmingsen
&amp; Castro, 2017). For the most part, this is attributable to the
infancy of countermessaging as it relates to violent extremismalthough
the effectiveness of public-service- announcements
(PSAs) on other sensitive topics (e.g., alcohol abuse, tobacco,
unprotected sex) has also been widely debated (for meta-analyses
see Derzon &amp; Lipsey, 2002; Jepson, Harris, Platt, &amp; Tannahill,
2010; Yadav &amp; Kobayashi, 2015; Werb et al., 2011). In addition to
this issue, a great concern is that most campaigns against political
violence contain graphically violent scenes involving torture, executions,
and corpses. For example, in the countermessage campaign
“Think again, turn away” launched by the United States
Department of State, the viewers are exposed to blown-up mosques,
suicide bombing, and other wanton acts of cruelty (Labott, 2014).
This is troubling because this is the type of visual content that is
highly attractive to sensation seekers (Zaleski, 1984; Zuckerman &amp;
Litle, 1986). Given the appeal of violent content to high sensation
seekers, it is likely that the very messages aimed to deter young
men from joining militant groups are the very messages that attract
them. What the present research indicates is that if these countermessages
are to be successful in decreasing support for political
violence, it is mission critical to include peaceful and stimulating
alternative social movements to get sensation seekers excited
about prosocial (vs. violent) political causes. Merely imploring the
viewers not to join these groups, to “say no to violence,” might
create psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966) and even elicit more
destructive behaviors, especially if individuals already hold strong
positive attitudes toward these groups, in which case other initiatives
to counter violent extremism might be necessary.
Countering extremism. Over the years, a slew of initiatives
has been proposed to help people disengage from politically violent
groups. These typically include initiatives such as mentoring,
creative arts, vocational training and sports (for a review see
Koehler, 2016). However, as pointed out by some of the leading
experts in the field, our understanding of the causal processes of
disengagement from violent extremism remains speculative (Gill,
Bouhana, &amp; Morrison, 2015). This is attributable to (a) a general
lack of theoretically grounded research in the field of counterradicalization
and (b) the lack of evaluation to examine the impact of
intervention methods to prevent or counter extremism (Horgan &amp;
Braddock, 2010). Deradicalization, Koehler (2016) notes, “remains
one of the most underresearched fields, which is even more
surprising, as the connection to successful counter-terrorism, peacekeeping,
and counter-radicalization policies is obvious” (p. 290).
The research herein described contributes to this inchoate literature
by providing “proof of concept” for a theory of change to reduce
support for political violence-a working model that spells out the
causal pathway to political violence for which interventions can
be devised to truncate that process. Precisely, our research indicates
that interventions to counter violent extremism should be
geared either toward (a) helping individuals construct a meaningful
personal narrative to quell the quest for significance or (b)
redirecting their desire for thrilling sensations toward exciting
prosocial groups (e.g., the Peace Corps or other NGOs conducting
humanitarian work abroad, etc.). Clearly, more research is needed
to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs and examine for
whom these interventions are most effective.</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_HEADING">Conclusion</zone>
  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">The present research extends recent work on Significance Quest
Theory (Dugas et al., 2016; Kruglanski, Gelfand, Bélanger, Sheveland,
et al., 2014) by demonstrating that sensation seeking is one
psychological mechanism linking people's search for meaning to
supporting extreme behaviors (e.g., support for political violence).
When individuals search for meaning, they look for novel and
intense experiences, thereby making them more likely to adhere to
violent ideologies or groups.
Understanding these principles, we developed and successfully
tested two interventions to thwart the radicalization process,
namely (a) reducing people's search for meaning by guiding them
to reflect on their personal, significance-providing, legacy and (b)
providing an exciting-yet peaceful-alternative group that satisfies
their need for exciting sensations. Both approaches are relevant
to prevention and intervention efforts to mitigate support for
political violence.</zone>
