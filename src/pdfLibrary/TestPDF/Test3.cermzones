  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Colombia is recognised for its overall high biodiversity and being number one for bird richness
globally. Colombia's rich biodiversity and the multiple values associated with it are threatened
by multiple drivers of change including deforestation and climate change. In this opinion
piece, we argue that to succeed in protecting forests and associated biodiversity in Colombia,
conservation actions need to consider local communities and focus on win-win situations for
biodiversity and people. We highlight the example of birdwatching tourism as a nature-based
solution that can help halt deforestation and contribute to climate change adaptation.
Climate induced environmental change is already affecting biodiversity globally [1]. In
Colombia, the predicted impacts of climate change are already being observed across different
ecoregions, including drier, warmer climates and an increase in extreme events [2,3]. In
response to these challenges, the Colombian government has taken an active, and rather pragmatic
approach to address climate change. The country's rich biodiversity is often at the core
of the country's ambitious goals to address climate change and meet global targets. Climate
change and biodiversity are often used in synergy as an opportunity for funding and to engage
in international collaborations. An example is Vision Amazonia, a climate mitigation and
anti-deforestation program in the Colombian Amazon.
As part of its adaptation commitments Colombia is looking to expand protected areas,
increase the protection of water resources, and the conservation of terrestrial and marine ecosystems
[4]. However, adaptation actions remain reactive, focusing on disaster risk reduction
and engineered solutions. Besides, the Colombian government has been unable to halt ongoing
environmental degradation and deforestation rates [5], which are maladaptive actions
inconsistent with discourses of biodiversity as an asset. In not addressing deforestation,
Colombia is not only compromising its ambitious climate adaptation agenda but nature's
capacity to support climate adaptation in the future.
In addressing deforestation, it is important to recognise the relevance of standing forests
and trees in supporting climate change policies, but also the multiple benefits for local communities
whose livelihoods rely on them [6]. Birdwatching tourism is an example of how forests
and tress connect people with nature, resulting in benefits to birds, forest conservation, and
rural livelihoods. Birds are good indicators of ecosystem health, serve as proxies for areas of
high biodiversity and endemism, and are important sentinels of climate change impacts on
ecosystems [7]. Birdwatching tourism is a good example of an adaptation service (also known
as nature's contribution to adaptation), which includes ecosystem services that provide alternatives
for people to adapt to climate-induced environmental change [8].</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">Birdwatching tourism can diversify rural household income while also enhancing bird conservation
through maintaining conserved habitats, forests, and trees (Fig 1). Birds sought after
by birdwatchers attract tourism activities to areas that would otherwise not benefit from tourism
due to their remoteness or difficult access, including areas that suffered from armed conflict
in the past [9] or areas where traditional livelihoods have been affected by climate change.
To realize the potential of this kind of specialized tourism, the local communities who benefit
from birdwatching tourism revenue must care for bird habitats and protect their populations,
develop specialized infrastructure and train personnel, and guarantee the safety of the tourists
[10]. Local communities whose livelihoods depend on farming are already facing the impacts
of unpredictable weather. For example, coffee farmers are looking to modify and diversify
their farming practices, such as protecting and planting shade trees in coffee farms through
and engaging in sustainable certification schemes and bird watching tourism to increase their
income (Fig 1D).
Birds and their habitats are already threatened by ongoing deforestation and climate change
in Colombia [11,12]. Colombia's birdwatching targets are distributed on all ecoregions but
there is a strong concentration on Andean forests, where fragmentation is higher and conservation
most urgent (forest map inset, Fig 1). Protecting birds through birdwatching tourism,
among other strategies, will ensure forest conservation and enhance climate change adaptation.
This is particularly important outside of protected areas, where habitat protection
through Indigenous peoples, local communities, and private conservation stewardships can
complement government-run initiatives. But the potential of realizing conservation and economic
benefits from birdwatching tourism is threatened by the interaction of climate change</zone>

  <zone label="BODY_CONTENT">and deforestation and its impacts on bird distributions and ecology. These threats will affect
species inside and outside of protected areas alike, just as deforestation soars inside national
parks in Colombia [5].
Despite the challenges, we see many opportunities ahead. Colombia's environmental policies
provide guidance to implement biodiversity conservation and climate change action
across scales [13], highlighting the potential of local-level actions to leverage ecosystem-based
adaptation. It also demonstrates the relevance of promoting locally based environmental governance
[14], which is fundamental in developing birdwatching tourism.
Expanding protected areas has been a political instrument to promote security and peace
[15], as well as to comply with the country's commitments to international agendas. But this
has not been enough to halt deforestation. To succeed in conserving standing forests and
allowing ecosystems and people to adapt to climate change, Colombia must shift from a reactive
to a proactive agenda, where adaptation strategies that benefit people and nature simultaneously
are prioritized. Similarly, Colombia's conservation sector should recognise the
multiple ways of relating with and using nature when designing conservation approaches. The
steady increase in birdwatching tourism in the last decades in Colombia [9] is an example of
the benefits of conserving forests, and offers options to identify, secure funding, and implement
other nature-based solutions that involve and benefit local communities and
biodiversity.</zone>
