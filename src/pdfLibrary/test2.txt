The Digital Object Identifier (DOI®) System is a managed system for persistent identification of content on digital networks. It can be used to identify physical, digital, or abstract entities. The identifiers (DOI names) resolve to data specified by the registrant, and use an extensible metadata model to associate descriptive and other elements of data with the DOI name. The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies, under policies and common infrastructure provided by the International DOI Foundation which developed and controls the system. The DOI system has been developed and implemented in a range of publishing applications since 2000; by early 2009 over 40 million DOIs had been assigned. The DOI system provides identifiers which are persistent, unique, resolvable, and interoperable and so useful for management of content on digital networks in automated and controlled ways.An identifier is a concise means of referencing something.
The term “identifier” can mean several different things:
        A “string,” typically a number or name, denoting a
specific entity (the referent of the identifier string).
For example, the identifier ISBN 978-0-00-721331-3
denotes the book “Francis Crick” by Matt Ridley.
A “specification,” which prescribes how such strings
are constructed. For example, the ISO standard ISO
2108:2005[
        1
        ] is the current specification of the ISBN
numbering system; but having that standard alone will
not enable someone to construct and register a new
valid ISBN.
      
        A “scheme,” which implements such a specification.
For example, the ISBN International Agency[
        2
        ]
implements the ISBN standard in an implemented scheme,
by assigning ISBN prefixes to publishers, registering
specific ISBNs (strings); providing rules on use of the
ISBN (such as the incorporation of the ISBN as a bar
code on the cover of a book). Typically, such schemes
provide a managed registry of the identifiers within
their control, in order to offer a related service.
Some important concepts relating to identifiers are
“uniqueness,” “resolution,” “interoperability,” and “persistence.”
      Uniqueness is the requirement that one string denotes
one and only one entity (the “referent”). Note that the
converse is not a logical consequence: it is not necessary
that an entity have only one identifier. For example, a
book may have an ISBN and also an LCCN. An identifier
scheme may even allow multiple identifiers for one entity,
though usually these are deprecated.Resolution is the process in which an identifier is the
input to a service to receive in return a specific output of
one or more pieces of current information related to the
identified entity. For example, a bar code ISBN in a
bookshop is scanned by a bar code reader and resolves to some
point of sale information, such as title and price. Note that
resolution depends on a particular application: while a bar
code in a bookshop may resolve to price, the same bar code
in a warehouse application might resolve to current stock
number, or pallet position. Another familiar example of
resolution is the Internet Domain Name System (DNS)
which resolves a domain name address (URL) to a file
residing on a specific host server machine.Interoperability denotes the ability to use an identifier
in services outside the direct control of the issuing
assigner: identifiers assigned in one context may be
encountered in another place or time without consulting the
assigner. This requires that the assumptions made on
assignment will be made known in some way. For example,
a customer may order a book from a bookseller or a
library system by quoting its ISBN, without consulting
the publisher who assigned the number.Persistence is the requirement that once assigned, an
identifier denotes the same referent indefinitely. For
example, ISBNs, once assigned, are managed so as to
reference the same book always (and are not reassigned).
Persistence can be considered to be “interoperability with
the future.”
        The management of content on digital networks requires
identifiers to be persistent, unique, resolvable, and
interoperable. As an example, URLs do not identify content but a
file location: using them as a substitute for such identifiers
is not sustainable for reliable automation. The content may
be removed (“404 not found”), or changed (not being the
same as the user anticipated, or the user being unaware of
such change). There have been a number of efforts to
address the need for such reliable identifiers, notable among
them URN[
        3
        ] and URI[
        4
        ] specifications; however these do
not of themselves provide an implemented managed
scheme and registry for specific content sector applications.
Such full schemes require more: a model for identifiers and
their management; shared, standards-based, persistent
identifier management infrastructure; support for adoption of
persistent identifiers and services, and a plan for sustainable
shared identifier infrastructure.[
        5,6
        ] The Digital Object
Identifier (DOI®) system is such a managed system for
persistent identification of content on digital networks, using a
federation of registries following a common specification.
      
        The uncapitalized term “digital object identifier” may be
used nonspecifically to describe a number of varied
technologies concerned with the identification of entities in a
digital environment. The capitalized term “Digital Object
Identifier” refers to one specific system defined and
managed by the International DOI Foundation,[
        7
        ] which
provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification
of entities (here termed “objects”) on digital networks
deployed in a number of content-related applications.
      DOI is an acronym for Digital Object Identifier. The DOI
system provides for unique identification, persistence,
resolution, metadata, and semantic interoperability of
content entities (“objects”). Information about an object can
change over time, including where to find it, but its DOI
name will not change.The DOI system brings together



A syntax specification, defining the construction of a
string (a DOI name)
A resolution component, providing the mechanism to
resolve the DOI name to data specified by the registrant
A metadata component, defining an extensible model
for associating descriptive and other elements of data
with the DOI name
A social infrastructure, defining the full
implementation through policies and shared technical
infrastructure in a federation of registration agencies
More detail on each of these aspects is given later in
this entry.The DOI system operates through a tiered structure:


        The International DOI Foundation is the umbrella
organization defining the rules and operation of the
system. It is a non-profit member-funded organization.
Registration agencies are all members of the
International DOI Foundation, and have a contractual

arrangement with the Foundation including a license
to operate the DOI system. They provide defined
services in specific sectors or applications. DOI
registration is normally only a part of the service such an
organization offers, since assignment of an identifier
is usually done for the purpose of a specific initial
service or application. An example is the CrossRef
registration agency,[
        8
        ] which provides services to
publishers for linking reference citations in articles based
on DOI-identified articles. Registration agencies may
collaborate, or remain relatively autonomous.
      DOI names are registered by clients via a registration
agency (e.g., in the case of the CrossRef agency,
individual publishers are clients using the CrossRef
service). Part of this process may be undertaken by the
registration agency, as part of its service offering. If a
suitable registration agency cannot be found for a
certain sector, the International DOI Foundation will seek
to appoint one.DOI is a registered trademark of the International DOI
Foundation, Inc. (abbreviated to IDF). The preferred
usage, to avoid ambiguity, is with a qualifier to refer to
either specific components of the DOI system (e.g., “DOI
name”: the string that specifies a unique referent within
the DOI system); or the system as a whole (“DOI
system”: the functional deployment of DOI names as the
application of identifiers in computer-sensible form
through assignment, resolution, referent description,
administration, etc.).
        The term “Digital Object Identifier” is construed as
“digital identifier of an object,” rather than “identifier of a
digital object”: the objects identified by DOI names may
be of any form—digital, physical, or abstract—as all
these forms may be necessary parts of a content
management system. The DOI system is an abstract framework
which does not specify a particular context of its
application, but is designed with the aim of working over the
Internet.[
        9
        ]
      
        A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object, to
provide a persistent link to current information about that
object, including where it, or information about it, can be
found. The principal focus of assignment is to
contentrelated entities; that term is not precisely defined but is
exemplified by text documents; data sets; sound carriers;
books; photographs; serials; audio, video, and audiovisual
recordings; software; abstract works; artwork, etc., and
related entities in their management, for example,
licenses or parties. A DOI name is not intended as a
replacement for other identifier schemes, such as those
of ISO TC46/SC9[
        10
        ] ISBN, ISSN, ISAN, ISRC, etc., or
iig–D iseD
lta ng
other commonly recognized identifiers: if an object is
already identified with another identifier string, the
character string of the other identifier may be integrated into
the DOI name syntax, and/or carried in DOI metadata, for
use in DOI applications.
      A DOI name may be assigned to any object whenever
there is a functional need to distinguish it as a separate
entity. Registration agencies may specify more
constrained rules for the assignment of DOI names to objects
for DOI-related services (e.g., a given registration agency
may restrict its activities to one type of content or one
type of service).
        A DOI name is the string that specifies a unique object
(the referent) within the DOI system. The DOI syntax
(standardized as ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005)[
        11
        ] prescribes
the form and sequence of characters comprising any DOI
name. The DOI syntax is made up of a “prefix” element
and a “suffix” element separated by a forward slash.
There is no defined limit on the length of the DOI name,
or of its prefix or its suffix elements. The DOI name is
case-insensitive and may incorporate any printable
characters from the Unicode Standard.

      Example: a DOI name with the prefix element
“10.1000” and the suffix element “123456”: 10.1000/
123456
The combination of a unique prefix element (assigned to a
particular DOI registrant) and a unique suffix element
(provided by that registrant) is unique, and so allows the
decentralized allocation of DOI numbers. The DOI name
is an opaque string for the purposes of the DOI system: no
definitive information should be inferred from the specific
character string of a DOI name. In particular, the
inclusion in a DOI name of any registrant code allocated to a
specific organization does not provide evidence of the
ownership of rights or current management responsibility
of any intellectual property in the referent. Such
information can be asserted in the associated DOI metadata.The DOI prefix has two components: a “Directory”
indicator followed by a “Registrant” code, separated by a
full stop (period) (e.g., 10.1000). The directory indicator
is always “10” and distinguishes the entire set of
character strings (prefix and suffix) as DOIs within the wider
Handle System® used for resolution. The registrant code is
a unique alphanumeric string assigned to an organization
that wishes to register DOI names (four digit numeric codes
are currently used though this is not a compulsory syntax).
The registrant code is assigned through a DOI registration
agency, and a registrant may have multiple-registrant
codes. Once a DOI name is assigned the string should not
be changed, regardless of any changes in the ownership


or management of the referent object; if an object is
withdrawn from digital access, its DOI name should still resolve
to some appropriate message to this effect.The DOI suffix may be a sequential number, or it may
incorporate an identifier generated from or based on
another system used by the registrant (e.g., ISBN, ISSN,
ISTC). In such cases, the existing system may specify its
own preferred construction for such a suffix:
Example: a DOI suffix using an ISSN: 10.1038/
issn.0028-0836.When displayed on screen or in print, a DOI name is
normally preceded by a lowercase “doi”: unless the
context clearly indicates that a DOI name is implied.Example: the DOI name 10.1006/jmbi.1998.2354 is
displayed as doi:10.1006/jmbi.1998.2354.The use of lowercase string “doi” follows the
specification for representation as a URI (as for e.g., “ftp:” and
“http:”).DOI names may be represented in other forms in
certain contexts. For example, when displayed in Web
browsers the DOI name itself may be attached to the address
for an appropriate proxy server (e.g., http://dx.doi.org/
resolves DOIs in the context of Web browsers using the
Handle System resolution technology) to enable
resolution of the DOI name via a standard Web hyperlink.Example: the DOI name 10.1006/jmbi.1998.2354
would be made an active link as http://dx.doi.org/
10.1006/jmbi.1998.2354.
        DOI names so represented in a URL and transported by
the HTTP protocol are constrained to follow standard IETF
guidelines for URI representations. The syntax for URIs is
more restrictive than the syntax for DOIs; some characters
are reserved and will need encoding (the NISO Z39.84
DOI syntax standard provides more detail). Certain client
or server software may be able to handle DOIs using
native handle resolution technology (where doi:10.1006/
jmbi.1998.2354 would be understood by the browser and
automatically resolved without the addition of the proxy
server address). DOI names may also be represented in
other schemes, for example, in the info URI schema[
        12,13
        ]
as info:doi/10.1006/jmbi.1998.2354.
      A DOI name can, within the DOI system, be resolved to
values of one or more types of data relating to the object
identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail
address, other identifiers, and descriptive metadata (or any
additional types defined extensibly by the registration
agency). Resolution is the process of submitting a specific
DOI name to the DOI system (e.g., by clicking on a DOI in
a Web browser) and receiving in return the associated
values held in the DOI resolution record for one or more
of those types of data relating to the object identified by
that DOI name. Since the referent objects referred to
by DOI names may be of various types (including
abstractions as “works,” physical “manifestations,”
performances), they may or may not be directly accessible in
the form of a digital file or other manifestation; hence the
resolution may or may not return an instance of the object.The initial implementation of DOI system was that of
persistent naming: a single redirection from a DOI name
to a digital location (URL) of the entity (Fig. 1).A significant DOI function is the capability for
multiple resolution, that is, delivering more than one value
back from a resolution request. The values are grouped
into defined types, which can form the basis of services
(Fig. 2). An example of current usage of this facility is
resolution to a specific local copy of an article,
determined by combining the resolution result (several URLs)
and local information about the user’s location (from the
user’s browser application).Objects (identified by DOI names) which have
common behavior (defined by metadata) can be grouped,
using DOI application profiles; these application profiles
can in turn be associated with one or more services
applicable to that group of DOI names (see Fig. 3).
        The Handle System,[
        14
        ] the resolution component used
in the DOI system, is a general-purpose distributed
information system designed to provide an efficient,
extensible, and secure global name service for use on
networks such as the Internet. The Handle System includes an
open set of protocols, a namespace, and a reference
implementation of the protocols. The DOI system is one
implementation of the Handle System; hence a DOI name is a
“Handle.” DOI names are distinguished from other
handles by additional “metadata” and “policy.” The Handle
System enables entities to be assigned first-class names,
independent of domain names and other location-specific
information, which can then be resolved (redirected) to
appropriate locations: since the resolution destination is
managed and can be changed, this provides a tool for
persistence, avoiding “404 not found” and similar
problems with URLs. The Handle System is used in a variety
of applications such as the Content Object Repository
Discovery and Resolution Architecture (CORDRA) of the
U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Distributed
Learning initiative; The Library of Congress National
Digital Library Program; and applications in grid
computing and advanced future Internet architectures. The Handle
System also includes several features not currently used in
the DOI system, such as trusted resolution using public
key infrastructure.
      
        The Handle System is part of a wider Digital Object
Architecture;[
        15
        ] that architecture specifically deals only
with digital objects with identifiers (Handles). There is no
conflict in these two views, since any non-digital entity
may be reified (or represented) as a corresponding digital
object for the purposes of digital object management

(though some care is needed in the definition of such
objects and how they relate to non-digital entities).
      The object associated with a DOI name is described
unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on an extensible
data model to support interoperability between DOI
applications. Assignment of a DOI name requires the registrant
to record metadata describing the object to which the DOI
name is being assigned. The metadata describes the object
to the degree that is necessary to distinguish it as a
separate entity within the DOI system.A minimum set of such metadata, the DOI kernel, is
specified by the IDF. This includes elements such as
“other identifier(s) commonly referencing the same
referent (e.g., ISBN, ISRC),” and the name by which the
referent is usually known (e.g., title). This minimum
kernel may be enhanced by registration agencies through
the development of specific application profiles with
metadata elements appropriate to a particular application
or set of applications. The IDF also specifies the template
for the exchange of metadata between DOI registration
agencies to support their service requirements, and
specifies a Data Dictionary as the repository for all data
elements and allowed values used in DOI metadata
specifications.The basis of the metadata scheme and extensions used
in the DOI system is the indecs (interoperability of data in
Fig. 3 DOI data model: the Application Profile Framework.
DOI names (identifying the entities on the left) are grouped into
application profiles. Any single DOI name can be a member of
multiple application profiles (e.g., DOI 10.5557/10 is shown
here in two). Each application profile can similarly be associated
with one or more services: each service can be made available in
multiple ways. This makes it possible to make a new service
applicable to many DOI names, simply by adding that service to
the relevant application profile(s).

        16
        ] This contextual
ontology approach to interoperability is shared by a number of
significant content sector activities.[
        17,18
        ] This allows the
use of a variety of existing metadata schemes with DOI
names in a common framework.
      The use of these tools for DOI metadata has been limited
in initial applications, but more applications are emerging
as the sophistication of content management on digital
networks and the need for interoperability increases.DOI names are intended to be persistent identifiers: no
time limit for the existence of a DOI name is assumed
in any assignment, service, or DOI application. A DOI
name and its referent are unaffected by changes in
the rights associated with the referent, or changes in the
management responsibility of the referent object. Since
such persistence requires a social infrastructure, policies
as well as technical infrastructure need to be defined and
implemented. The IDF develops and implements policies
such as rules for transfer of management responsibility
between registration agencies, requirements placed on
registration agencies for maintenance of records, default
resolution services, and technical infrastructure resilience.
These are codified in a formal agreement between the IDF
and each of the registration agencies.The DOI system is not a means of archival
preservation of identified entities; it does not store the identified
objects themselves; nor does the central DOI Directory
store comprehensive metadata (only pointers to the
registration agency or other source of such data). The system
provides a means to continue interoperability through
exchange of meaningful information about identified entities
through at minimum persistence of the DOI name and a
description of the referent.The DOI system was the result of a publishing industry
initiative in the late 1990s, which recognized the need to
uniquely and unambiguously identify content entities, rather
than refer to them by locations, and commissioned a study to
specify an appropriate technical solution, selected if possible
from one or more existing technologies rather than
developing a new system. The International DOI Foundation was
incorporated in 1998 to develop the system; where possible,
existing technologies and standards were adopted for the
implementation of the DOI system. The first DOI
registration agency began in 2000; by early 2009 around 40 million
DOI names had been assigned through eight registration
agencies. The most widely known application of the DOI
system is the Crossref cross-publisher citation linking
service which allows a researcher link from a reference citation
directly to the cited content on another publisher’s platform,
subject to the target publisher’s access control practices.
Other applications include government documentation,
books, and data; further applications are under development.The development of the DOI system has proceeded
through three parallel tracks:


An initial implementation of persistent naming: a
single redirection from a DOI name to a digital location
(URL) of the entity or information about it.The development of more sophisicated means of
management such as contextual resolution, where the result
of a redirection is also a function of some additional
information such as local holdings information.
Collaboration with other standards activities in the
further development of tools for managing entities in
a digital environment.
The DOI System is a Draft International Standard of ISO,
it is expected that the final standard will be published in
late 2009 or 2010.The DOI system is associated with two independent
technical activities which it has used as components of DOI
implementations: the Handle System and the series of
contextual ontology initiatives derived from the indecs
project. Each is used in other non-DOI applications (an
aim of the International DOI Foundation was to use
existing solutions where available and proven to be useful).
Either of these components could be replaced in the DOI
system by other technologies offering similar features in
the future if necessary.The International DOI Foundation, particularly
through its registration agency CrossRef, has also been
closely involved in the development of the OpenURL, a
mechanism for transporting metadata and identifiers
describing a publication for the purpose of context-sensitive
linking. The DOI system is now widely implemented
using OpenURL by many libraries: further information
on this topic is available from the Crossref Web site. The
use of open URL was the first widespread example of
more sophisticated means of content management through
contextual resolution.The expertise of the International DOI Foundation in
issues such as resolution and semantic interoperability
has also led to some IDF members being active
participants in discussions of further identifier scheme
development such as the International Standard Text Code (ISTC)
numbering system for the identification of textual works,
and identifiers for parties (persons and organizations), and
licenses.
